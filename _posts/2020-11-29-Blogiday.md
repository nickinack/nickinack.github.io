With my 3rd semester @ IIIT-H ending today, I would like to start off with my second blog post. This sem has been very hectic for me and my friends, but the learnings have been 
immense! Despite the fact that the entire semester was held online, we were made to explore various domains and the crosslinkings between them. The topics ranged from solving higher 
order pertubations in quantum mechanics to applying genetic algorithms in Machine Learning and Higher order non linear equation solving! I am posting this blog in order to share some of my 
learnings, projects and term papers I wrote during this semester over the course of 3.5 months. Me and my friends explored various topics like RNA Sequencing, Genetic Algorithms, Quantum
Information Theory, Algorithms, Database systems, Markov Chains and so much more! 

## Genesis

Genesis is our (Me, <a href="https://github.com/abhishekh2001">Abhishekh Sivakumar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ArenaGrenade">Rohan Asokan</a>) take on understanding how genetic 
algorithms go hand in hand in order with problem solving. Inspired from Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, we created a Genetic Algorithm library and applied it in order to solve 
the Travelling Salesman problem (no premature convergence was found for a node count upto 63), higher order equations and feature selection (coding walkthrough) in Machine Learning. The live demo can be
viewed <a href="http://teamc-aad.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. In order to get different test cases for a problem, please reload the page. The library is scalable and overridable with your own
population functions! Our team had a great experience creating this library and the transition from a traditional algorithmic course to a learning extravagenza definitely created a big impact on us 
and we look forward to do more stuff like this!

## Local Realism

My quantum mechanics term paper involved discussing about Realism and the how the concept of relaism were intepreted by various propositions. The paper can be viewed
<a href="https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/personal/subhadip_mitra_iiit_ac_in/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fsubhadip%5Fmitra%5Fiiit%5Fac%5Fin%2FDocuments%2FQuantum%20Mechanics%2FTerm%20Papers%2F2019113015%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fsubhadip%5Fmitra%5Fiiit%5Fac%5Fin%2FDocuments%2FQuantum%20Mechanics%2FTerm%20Papers">here.</a>
Realism is often considered to be a philosophical determination of occurrences of natural phenomenon. An event is said to be completely deterministic 
if the outcome of the event can be predicted with 100 percentage accuracy before the event has occured in the realms of the universe. It is to be noted that 
realism varies with localities. A locality with one perception of realism (or even determinism) of a physical quantity need to necessarily mean that another 
locality may have the same perception of reality (or even determinism). In the first part of the paper, the inferences from the Copenhagen principle have been 
discussed. In the second part,the Bohm version of the EPR Paradox has been discussed. In the third part, a simple discrete approach has been provided as a prelude
to the Bell’s theorem. In the fourth part, we discuss the correlativistic Bell’s inequality. We conclude the paper by discussing few interpretation of the Bell’s 
inequality.

## HCDBMS

HCDBMS is an administrator side Hotel Chain database management system made as a part of CS4.301 Data and Applications, Monsoon 2020. The project has been divided into four phases and the details of each of these phases have been shared in this repository.
The phases are as follows were creating a requirements doc, ER diagram, normalizing the relations and coding the CLI. We have used MySQL and PyMySQL client library to interact with the SQL Database. Some 
key features of our implementation include extensive update and cascading properties, proper constraint specification and guest anonymity. While this project may be on the "easy" spectrum, coding this project up
and testing it extensively helped us gauge a broader idea on database management and insights on handling databases efficiently.


## Chip-Seq

The course, which was supposed to be a primer to grade 12 Biology went too far! While the course was very hectic with almost fifteen quizzes (sigh!), we managed to end the course on a good note
with our term papers. My term paper involved researching about Chip-Sequencing and taking further steps from Chip-Sequencing into more efficient algorithms. I also noted inferences from the Data Analysis of Chip-Seq experiments using PCA emulated graphs(e.g.: C/EBPa
ChIPseq genome track at the albumin locus in mouse hepatocytes). The paper was concluded by listing out the advantages of Chip-Seq and links for further reading. The pdf of this term paper
can be viewed <a href="https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/karthik_viswanathan_research_iiit_ac_in/Ea7ThXlZa-NMtfGY9IUZGDwBaC9XU2dg23szYd-4pN1Syw?e=FBAxMp">here</a>.

## Bayesian Statistics, Markov Chains, Evolutionary relationships and Promoter finding

<img src="https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/fb-thumb.png"/>

For the course probability and random processes, we were given a group project in order to interlink the applications between probability and bioinformatics. While this crosslinking is
very abstract, we went through various sources in order to learn (and code a little) about promoter matching, gene finding and evolutionary relationships using the concept of likelihood.
This was fairly new to us as we did not have much experience on bioinformatics while working on this topic. The main importance of using bayesian models is to reduce manual analysing and reduce
sequence lengths using probablistic models, proposing controversial hypothesis and inferring its likelihood.

## UPGMA

In this "mini" project, I created phylogenetic relationships using agglomerative clustering from scratch. ```BLOSUM62``` score matrices, Neucleotide and protein allignments were
given to us and we had to construct phylogenetic relationships from scratch taking gaps into consideration. This mini project was done over a span of two days. Phylogenetic trees are used to
understand evolutionary relationships between sets of organisms given their gene sequences. The mini-project can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/nickinack/UPGMA">here</a>.

## Gans4Good and Neuroscience

<img src="https://eay.cc/uploads/2011/partygans.gif" />

I am a big fan of Deeplearning.ai's courses and I signed up for the Generative adversarial networks course. The course introduced me to generating new datasets with GANS, controllable
generation, CGANs, WGANs and much more! Me and my colleagues tried to use variational autoencoders and 3-D GANs in order to reconstruct ssfMRI images. The work is still going on and
we hope to near its completion by the end of January. My learnings from this amazing course instructed by Sharon Zhou, the codes for the assignments can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/nickinack/GANS4GOOD">here</a>.
The repository is still a work in progress and it will be updated as I complete more courses and projects on GANs. 

## Holiday season!

The holidays are finally here. I really did not give much importance to my GPA this year (I think I should have); but I carried away so much this semester! With the holiday season nearning, 
I'm going to start my winter research @ SENAI, IIT-M under Prof. Raghunathan Rengaswamy. Along with research, I hope to focus more on my personal life and goals. I'll start writing non-academic blogs, 
try to improve my literary skills and practice Hindustani Classical Music during these holidays. You can e-mail me about how you felt about this blog whether I spent my time well.
