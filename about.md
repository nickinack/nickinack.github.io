I am <b>Karthik Viswanathan</b>. I am an undergraduate student at IIIT-Hyderabad. I am currently enrolled in the dual degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Computational Sciences. I hope to specialize in the field of Neuroscience and Computer Vision. 

### Research

I have broad interests in Computer Vision, Machine learning and Neuroscience. My research is mostly driven by the following goals:

- To understand how the human brain <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/28/12/4136/4560155https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/28/12/4136/4560155"> encodes and decodes</a> vision and how this vision can be obtained and represented from these decodings. 
- To generate new datasets for existing datasets in Pathology using <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan">Generative adversarial networks</a> using existing datasets. I am looking to segment and do a controllable generation of pathological images and use them for detecting early stage pathological diseases.
- Unserstanding the establishment of biomolecular sequence-structure-function relations using fundamental principles of physical sciences in theoretical models and simulations of structure and dynamics.

### Projects

- <b>Genesis</b>: Genesis is a library created using Python in order to implement Genetic Algorithms. Genetic Algorithms(GAs) were inspired by the Charles Darwin theory of natural selection and we have added functionalities for an abstract GA solver and used it to optimize the travelling salesman problem (TSP), approximate the minimal roots of a non-linear equation and feature selection in the field of Machine Learning.

- <b>Bone 2-D</b>: Implementation of the paper, Bone Structures Extraction, and Enhancement in Chest Radiographs via CNN Trained on Synthetic Data published in March 2020 by Ophir Gozes and Hayit Greenspan. The process involves converting a 3-D X-Ray (CXR) into Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRR) using Computer Vision. Previous works on this domain used FCNNs and L1 Loss for calculating the predicted DRR. This method proposes a new model: a trainable UNET and a non-trainable VGG19 network (in order to calculate perpetual loss using the conv3d outputs).

- <b>HCDBMS</b>: HCDBMS is an administrator side Hotel Chain database management system made as a part of CS4.301 Data and Applications, Monsoon 2020. The project has been divided into four phases and the details of each of these phases have been shared in this repository. The phases are as follows were creating a requirements doc, ER diagram, normalizing the relations and coding the CLI. We have used MySQL and PyMySQL client library to interact with the SQL Database. Some key features of our implementation include extensive update and cascading properties, proper constraint specification and guest anonymity.

- <b>MLC++</b>: The MLC++ is a collection of C++ Emulators for unsupervised clustering algorithms. The algorithms coded are KNN clustering , DBSCAN clustering and PCA reduction with optimised space and time complexity. The objective of this project is to get a deeper understanding and working of each of the above mentioned algorithm. Work is in progress. The project uses file handling as a method to store data. Programs have been segmented into modular files in order to have an easier workflow.


### Survey Papers (Links at Blog)

- <b>Chip-Seq, an enhanced RNA-Seq</b>:  The paper involved researching about Chip-Sequencing and taking further steps from Chip-Sequencing into more efficient algorithms. I also noted inferences from the Data Analysis of Chip-Seq experiments using PCA emulated graphs(e.g.: C/EBPa ChIPseq genome track at the albumin locus in mouse hepatocytes). The paper was concluded by listing out the advantages of Chip-Seq and links for further reading. 

- <b>Bayesian Statistics, Markov Chains, Evolutionary relationships and Promoter finding</b>: This review paper mainly focused at a great depth on the applications of probability in the field of bioinformatics.
