I am <b>Karthik Viswanathan</b>. I am an undergraduate student at IIIT-Hyderabad. I am currently enrolled in the dual degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Computational Sciences. I hope to specialize in the field of Neuroscience and Computer Vision. 

### Research

I have broad interests in Computer Vision, Machine learning and Neuroscience. My research is mostly driven by the following goals:

- To understand how the human brain <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/28/12/4136/4560155https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/28/12/4136/4560155"> encodes and decodes</a> vision and how this vision can be obtained and represented from these decodings. 
- To generate new datasets for existing datasets in Pathology using <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan">Generative adversarial networks</a> using existing datasets. I am looking to segment and do a controllable generation of pathological images and use them for detecting early stage pathological diseases.
